## [Xitter Checkmark Remover](https://github.com/akkaygin/tiny-userscripts/raw/refs/heads/main/removeXitterCheckmarks.user.js)
Checkmarks fried my brain and took away my ability to interact with posts, in case if they are engagement bait. Does what is says on the can and removes **every** checkmark from the website (as long as they do not change the way they are inserted).

New reddit is disgusting, redirects regular `reddit.com` links to `old.reddit.com`.
